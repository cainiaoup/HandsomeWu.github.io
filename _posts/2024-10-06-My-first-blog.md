title:  "How to use Jekyll to build a blog or personal homepage ?"
---

## Motivation:

I want to build a blog website of myself just like [lilian weng][lilian-weng]. 

I think it's cool and interesting. 🆒

The baseline is guided by Copliot 🐮. Thanks for Copliot's help and advice on using Jekyll to build it 💓.

That's the reason why I use Jekyll instead of Hugo, which  [lilian weng][lilian-weng] used.

So, some of the build code below is generated by Copliot. I have checked and revised the error code.

Help it's useful for you guys !! 🤗🤗🤗🤗

## Device and Package:
- MacOS
- Github
- ruby
  - bundler
  - jekyll
  
> Hint: if you meet the problem that have to update the version of ruby, please remember use rbenv and ruby-build.

```bash
brew install rbenv
brew install ruby-build

echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

rbenv install 3.0.0
rbenv global 3.0.0

# verify the version of Ruby
ruby -v 
```

## Build Steps:

### Step 1: Create a repository on your github account. 

create a new repository named `your-username.github.io`, which `your-username` must be your github account name.

### Step 2: Install Ruby ,Bundler and jekyll

**Install Ruby and Bundler**
```bash
brew install ruby
gem install bundler
```

**Install Ruby and jekyll**
```bash
gem install jekyll
```

### Step 3: Create Jekyll Site

```bash 
cd path/to/your/directory

jekyll new your-username.github.io

cd your-username.github.io
```

now you can get the baseline file tree:
```

```
### Step 4: Configuration Jekyll
